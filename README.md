Stroke Prediction with Neural Networks and report.

A Stroke is a medical disorder in which regions of the brain are deprived of blood flow, resulting in a stroke, which can be deadly. Because the number of stroke cases is rising at an alarming rate, it is necessary to investigate the factors that influence the rate of growth of these instances. It is necessary to develop a method for predicting whether or not a person will be impacted by a stroke. This research examines machine learning techniques for better stroke prediction. With this in mind, this study employed deep learning techniques such as Neural Networks to create a model for an accurate prediction using a variety of physiological parameters. To detect the association between these distinct variables, various plots are used in the investigation. The research also demonstrates how certain characteristics, like as age, heart conditions, and smoking status, are essential, while others, such as residence, are not. As patients get older they are more at risk of suffering a stroke, heart problems greatly increase the risk of stroke, and the same is true for married people and those working in more stressful conditions. After the analysis and modeling, the algorithm has approximately reached an 80% accuracy rate with a recall of 0.6.
